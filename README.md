# Vite + React + Material UI + Auth Starter with TypeScript
    
This starter template combines the power of Vite, React, Material UI, and TypeScript to provide a robust foundation for building professional React applications efficiently. It is an evolution of the original [@karpolan](https://github.com/karpolan) [react-typescript-mui-with-auth-starter]              (https://github.com/karpolan/react-typescript-mui-with-auth-starter).

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository from: https://github.com/karpolan/vite-react-material-ui-with-auth-starter
2. Replace `_TITLE_` and `_DESCRIPTION_` in all files with your own text.
3. Create favorite icon images and place them into `/public/img/favicon`. The `favicon.ico` file should be placed in the root of the `/public` folder.
4. Add your own code :)
